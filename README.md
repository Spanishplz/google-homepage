Project done following The Odin Project.
This static web-page was done to practice basic HTML and CSS.

New things: 
- Needed to visualize different sections and divide the web as better as I could.
- First time using flex-box and grid to align elements. At the beginning was really confusing. Ended up mixing them up in some cases. Really useful.
- Learning about the different display options depending on the element. Some times I wanted them as a block, or as an inline element. 
- My first CSS Sprite. This one was really tricky. I didn't know how was it
  possible to make the bottom "Goooooooooooogle" image.
- While learning about the sprite  I had to learn about tables too. I believe it could've been done easier with flexbox.
- On the Video sections of the results you can find the key moments, which are
  timestamps in the video. I'm not sure if I did it the right way. It works but
  was like drawing with css. It isn't interactive like it's supposed to, of course. In some other
  search results the timestamps bar can even scroll to the side. Not sure how that can be done yet.
- Learned a little about SVG images and how to use them. Trying to format some of the ones that were already made. I could put some text next to them too.
- Got better at using the "grab a color" tool to make the page look similar.
- Doing this project I got better at using the text editor. Found some useful hotkey to speed things up.
- I just found out about "https://fonts.google.com/icons". So I just realize that I need to read better the explanation of the projects. Got my icons from somewhere else.

This was a good start!
